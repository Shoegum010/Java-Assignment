2>The second assignment was using the SOLID principle we need to apply it on our codes and make a payment system which supports SOLID principle.
in this assignment i got to know about the SOLID principle which makes our code more robust and good in design.
S-Single responsibility principle
O-Open Closed Principle
L-Liskov's Principle
I-Interface Segregation Principle.
D-Dependency Inversion Principle.
using this principles i implemented only the first four . The last Principle was little bit complex .
